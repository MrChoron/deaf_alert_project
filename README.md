# deaf_alert_project
This project aims to assist deaf or hard of hearing individuals by utilizing the UrbanSound8K dataset with the help of deep learning and a graphical user interface (GUI). It helps us notify individuals with hearing impairments.
The dataset credit goes to the UrbanSound8K team for providing this valuable resource.
